## git pull:

- `git pull` is a combination of two commands:
    - `git fetch`: Retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them into your local branch.
    - `git merge`: Attempts to integrate the fetched changes into your current local branch.
- If there are no conflicts (changes made to the same file in both local and remote repositories), the `git pull` command merges the changes seamlessly.
- If conflicts arise, Git will halt the merge process and highlight the conflicting sections in the affected files. You'll need to resolve these conflicts manually before continuing.
