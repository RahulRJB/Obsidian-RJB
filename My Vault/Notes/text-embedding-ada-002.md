### **Model Architecture Selection**

- **Transformer Architecture**: The text-embedding-ada-002 model, like many modern NLP models, is likely based on a transformer architecture. Transformers are highly effective for capturing the context and meaning of text by leveraging self-attention mechanisms.
- **Embedding Layer**: The model starts with an embedding layer that converts tokens (words or sub-words) into dense vectors of fixed size. This layer learns to map similar words or phrases to similar points in a high-dimensional space.
