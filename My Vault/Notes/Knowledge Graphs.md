- **Grasp the core concept**: Unlike vector-based memory (which mem0 uses), graph memory stores information as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships). For example, instead of storing "John works at Google" as an embedding, you'd store nodes for "John" and "Google" with an edge labeled "works_at" connecting them.
- **Understand why graphs matter for agents**: Graphs enable multi-hop reasoning ("John works at Google → Google is in Mountain View → Therefore John likely lives near Mountain View"), temporal tracking (relationship changes over time), and structured knowledge representation.
