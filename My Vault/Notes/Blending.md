Blending is a simpler and often faster alternative to stacking. It also combines the predictions of multiple models, but it does it in a more direct way, without using the concept of a meta-model learning to optimally weigh those predictions based on cross validation.

**How Blending Works (Step-by-Step):**

1. **Data Split:**
    
    - You divide your training data into three parts:
        
        - Training set (used for training your base-level models)
            
        - Validation set (used for creating the blended predictions)
            
        - Test set (used to test the final blended model)
            
2. **Base Model Training:**
    
    - You train several different base-level models using the **training set** only.
        
3. **Base Model Prediction on Validation Set:**
    
    - You apply the trained base models to generate predictions on the **validation set**.
        
4. **Blending:**
    
    - You combine the predictions from the base models using some kind of weighting mechanism, usually a simple average, weighted average, or a voting scheme.
        
    - **Simple Average:** Takes the straight average of each prediction from the various models.
        
    - **Weighted Average:** Assigns weights to each model's prediction according to performance on the validation set. (e.g. better performing models get higher weights).
        
    - **Voting:** In classification tasks, this involves taking the majority vote amongst the various models. (e.g. if 3 models predict class 0, and 2 models predict class 1, then the final blended model will predict class 0).
        
5. **Final Predictions on Test Data:**
    
    - To predict on the test set or new data, you simply obtain the predictions from all of the base models, and then combine them with the same blending method you used on the validation set.
        

**Key Characteristics of Blending:**

- **Simplified Combination:** Direct combination of base model predictions through averaging or voting.
    
- **No Meta-Model Training:** It does not train another model on the predictions.
    
- **Less Computationally Intensive:** Faster to implement than stacking because no meta model is trained.
    
- **Validation Set:** Relies on a held-out validation set for creating predictions and testing.
    
- **Potential for Data Loss:** Because part of the original training data must be set aside for validation to make the aggregated predictions, some potentially helpful training data is lost.
    

**Key Differences Summarized:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|Stacking|Blending|
|**Structure**|Hierarchical (base models + meta-model)|Direct combination of base model predictions|
|**Meta-Model**|A model is trained to combine predictions.|No new model is trained|
|**Training Data**|Uses out-of-fold predictions during cross-validation.|Uses a separate validation dataset|
|**Computational Cost**|More computationally expensive due to cross-validation.|Less computationally intensive|
|**Overfitting**|More resistant to overfitting due to cross-validation|Can be more prone to overfitting if the validation set is not sufficient.|
|**Flexibility**|Can be more flexible due to meta-model|Less flexible|
|**Complexity**|More complex to implement|Simpler and easier to implement.|

**When to Use Which:**

- **Stacking:** Use when you want maximum performance and have sufficient computational resources. It's generally considered more robust to overfitting and might lead to slightly better results than blending.
    
- **Blending:** Use when you want a simpler and faster ensemble method. It can provide good performance, especially when computational resources are limited.
