### Goals of BM25:
- Addresses Issues with Tf-IDf
- Better version of [[Tf-IDf]]. It improves the TF part, so that it has diminishing returns to increase in the term frequency. Means that the more matching terms you add, we are going to get more points but we wont get the same amount of extra points the further you go. We would get less and less and less and less extra points.
- Penalty for long docs. 

BM25- Best matching, 25th version.
