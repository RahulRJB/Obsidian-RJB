### Goals of BM25:
- Addresses Issues with Tf-IDf
- Better version of [[Tf-IDf]]. It improves the TF part, so that it has diminishing returns to increase in the term frequency. Means that the more matching terms you add, we are going to get more points but we wont get the same amount of extra points the further you go. We would get less and less and less and less extra points.
- Penalty for long docs. 

### BM25:

- BM25- Best matching, 25th version.![[Attachments/Pasted image 20240711105535.png]]θ =  length of this document/Average length of all of the documents in the corpus. Tells us how much longer is this document compared to the average document that exists in your Corpus
  k, b = tunable parameters



- NOTE: Take partial derivatives of any formula you dont understand. Tells you how does the form of the derivative change if I increase the thing which I took the derivative with respect to.
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20240711110635.png]]t= shorthand for Tf;    i=shorthand for IDf
- Partial derivative of BM25 wrt t(Tf):
	-  Derivative always positive bcs k and b are +ve, 
	-  Diminishing returns to scale which is exactly what we wanted.

- Partial derivative of BM25 wrt θ:
	- Neg relationship, 
	- Also diminishing returns![[Attachments/Pasted image 20240711111243.png]]
