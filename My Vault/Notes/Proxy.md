- Proxy server is a middleman between you and the internet. When you try to visit a website, normally your device would send a request directly to the website's server. But with a proxy server, your request goes to the proxy server first.
- Breakdown:
	1. **Request to Proxy:** You enter a website address in your browser. This request gets sent to the proxy server instead of the website directly.
	2. **Proxy Fetches Content:** The proxy server receives your request and acts on your behalf. It sends its own request to the website using its own IP address.
	3. **Response to Proxy:** The website's server responds by sending the data (the website content) back to the proxy server.
	4. **Proxy Delivers Content:** The proxy server then receives the data from the website and sends it back to you.

- By acting as an intermediary, proxy servers offer several advantages:
	- **Privacy:** They can mask your IP address, making it harder for websites to track your location.
	- **Security:** Some proxies can filter malicious content or add an extra layer of security.
	- **Access:** Certain proxies can bypass geo-blocking restrictions, allowing you to access content that might be unavailable in your region.
