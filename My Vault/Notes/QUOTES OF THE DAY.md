- Perfection is the enemy of Good!
- Comfort is the worst addiction!
- Is today better than yesterday!?
- Limited amount of dopamine in a day
- Hustle karo bhasar nahi
- People underestimate the amount of work they can do over a long period of time and overestimate the amount of work they can do over a short period of time.
- Work today so that your past is not dissapointed and future is proud.
