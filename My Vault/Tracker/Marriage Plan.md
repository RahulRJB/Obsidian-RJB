## Songs:  
Until I found you  
Perfect  
Bade acche lagte hai



<van side by side dont know each other>
I found a love for me  
<Walk by the college; Ruchira comes from benhind holds hand>
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
<Classroom; exchanging notes> 
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet  
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me


<Classroom; Ruchira siting and giggling, I sit by her side and look at her in admiration> 
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowin' what it was  
<Cut to dance shot; Balle dance>
I will not give you up this time  
Oh, darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own  
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

<picnic shot; listening wired headphones>
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms  
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song  
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath  
But you heard it, "Darling, you look perfect tonight"

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know  
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday, I'll share her home  
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets  
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love, fightin' against all odds  
I know we'll be alright this time  
Darling, just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man  
I see my future in your eyes

Oh, baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms  
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song  
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful  
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

No, no, no  
Mm, oh

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms  
Barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song  
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met  
An angel in person, and she looks perfect

Though I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight
